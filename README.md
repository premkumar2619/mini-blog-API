# mini-blog-API
The mini-blog API is a straightforward blog application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This project provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, allowing users to manage blog posts efficiently. Each post includes a username and content, and the data is stored in memory. The application uses various technologies, including Node.js as the runtime environment, Express.js as the web framework, and EJS as the templating engine. Additionally, it employs the Method-Override middleware to handle HTTP verbs such as PUT and DELETE and uses UUIDs to generate unique identifiers for each post.
